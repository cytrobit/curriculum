      <h2 class="subdiv">Profile</h2>
      <p>As a freelancer in frontend development I had full control over four commercial projects (sutasz.art, frontend.ovh, tobasport.pl, intergalactic.shop.pl) I made from scratch (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RWD, Bootstrap). Until now I do cooperate with owners. During my work as a social worker I have created calculator to count 90 days of insurance for our Clients and I received a lot of positive feedback.</p>
      <p>I'm responsible, result-oriented developer with great willing to learn new skills. </p>
      <p>My hobbies are: demoscene, music composition and frontend development.</p>
